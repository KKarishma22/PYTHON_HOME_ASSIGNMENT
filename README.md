## DESCRIPTION
Have you ever wondered how anticipation lights up specific brain regions? Well, this home assignment delves into exactly that--visualizing Reward Anticipation in the brain by leveraging functional and structural MRI data from the [Neurosynth](https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/reward%20anticipation/) platform. Additionally, I've also explored the distribution of positive values in the functional data by plotting a histogram.
